# IPv4 Subnet Calculator ðŸ§®

A lightweight, educational IPv4 subnet calculator built in Python. This project is intended as a learning tool to explore core Python concepts like input validation, bitwise operations, and string manipulation.

There are any number of modules and functions available for interacting with IPv4, but I specifically wanted to avoid using any of these, as the specific goal of this project is to learn about using the Python language.

This is currently still very much a work in progress, so check back regularly or follow this project for updates.

## Features

Intended features:
- Validates IPv4 addresses and CIDR notation
- Calculates subnet masks, network address, broadcast address, host ranges
- CLI-based interaction
- Designed for readability and learning
