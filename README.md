# IPv4 Subnet Calculator ðŸ§®

A lightweight, educational IPv4 subnet calculator built in Python. This project is intended as a learning tool to explore core Python concepts like input validation, bitwise operations, and string manipulation.

There are any number of modules and functions available for interacting with IPv4, but I specifically wanted to avoid using any of these, as the specific goal of this project is to learn about using the Python language.

This is currently still very much a work in progress, so check back regularly or follow this project for updates.

## Features

Intended features:
- âœ… Validates IPv4 addresses and CIDR notation
- âœ… Calculates subnet masks, network address, broadcast address, host ranges
- CLI-based interaction
- Designed for readability and learning

## TODO
- Move binary calculator to helpers
- Calculate host count
- Move wildcard calculator to helpers
- Add wrapper function to perform all calculations in one step

## IPv6

Please note that this module does not currently support IPv4, but this will be added in a future version

## Example Output

The intent is for this to use a wrapper function to output all values as a single JSON dictionary. See examples/output.json for an example.
